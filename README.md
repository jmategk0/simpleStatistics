# simpleStatistics
simpleStatistics is a lightweight statistics library written in pure python.

The goal of this project is to provide the python community with a simple statistics library compatible with python 2.7 
and 3.4+. The scope of this project is that the module should handle the statistical formulas and tests typically found 
in a semester long undergraduate research statistics course. simpleStatistics is intended to have a very low learning
curve for people with a rudimentary understanding of statistics so they can solve problems in code more quickly.
